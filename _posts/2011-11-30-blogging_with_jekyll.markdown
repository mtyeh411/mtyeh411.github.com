I have decided to use [jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki) to power this blog.  Jekyll is written as a Ruby gem and describes itself as a "blog aware, static site generator".  Static site generators, like Jekyll, are gaining traction in the dev world...and it's not because vintage is currently en vogue. 

A static site generator parses and processes marked up textfiles into static HTML files.  Jekyll is specifically 'blog aware' because it inherently handles the basic 'dynamic content' of blogs: blog posts, dates, titles, etc.

After being so engulfed in dynamic, database-driven blogging content management systems for almost a decade, having a site composed of static HTML pages is quite refreshing.  So what are the advantages?
