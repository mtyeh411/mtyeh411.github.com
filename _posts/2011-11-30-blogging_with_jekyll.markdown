In the beginning was HTML and HTML was the Web and the Web was HTML.  It seems like eons ago when we were generating sites that were strictly static pages: no Wordpress, no Drupal, no backend databases; just HTML (and perhaps a splash of prehistoric JS or ActionScript).  You know how they say that history repeats itself?  Well, here we are in the height of the second generation of the Web, having learned our lessons from ages past and moving on to loftier visions of what it means to be "connected", and then comes Jekyll and its siblings to blow everything back to the stone age...sort of.

So what is Jekyll?  Jekyll is a static site generator written in Ruby.  And it's great!  

What are the benefits of "reverting" to a static site?  Well, for one, deployment is dead simple.  The static files generated from Jekyll can be served up from any web server.  In fact, if I wanted some free web hosting, I could have my entire site publicly accessible straight from my public Dropbox folder.  One of the greatest benefits is supremely fast loading times, since there is absolutely no magic happening on the server side.  So long as I'm not trying to serve full-res images
